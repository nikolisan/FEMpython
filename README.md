# FEM for Python
This project is my implementation of FEM for structures as part of my coursework in MSc Civil and Water Engineering at Cardiff University
This is a project under developement.

## Project Structure
The main package, fempy, is divided into four subpackages:
- **[elements](fempy/elements):** This subpackage contains a set of classes for structural elements, like Triangular2D element, Bar2D element, etc.
- **[mesh](fempy/mesh):** This subpackage provides helper classes for automatic mesh generation.
- **[solvers](fempy/solvers):** This is the main subpackage, which contains all the solver classes for many different applications.
- **[examples](fempy/examples):** As the name states, this package provides some small commented scripts to help the user structure his approach.
